If you include a second question mark in the query, this would be treated as a literal question mark (i.e. it has no significance beyond that of a regular character).

Internal,,Potential Issue,Low,URL contains repetitive elements,"URLs that contain repetitive elements in the URL path, which can cause duplicate content issues or broken internal links. Repetitive elements in URL paths are usually caused when the crawler comes across links with relative URLs and the page doesn't have a base URL e.g. https://example.com/pages/pages/page1.

Internal,,Potential Issue,Low,Query string contains repetitive parameters,"URLs that contain repetitive parameters in the query string (e.g. http://example.com/page?a=1&a=1). Since the second parameter is redundant, the existence of these URLs could lead to duplicate content issues, since the content would be identical to the equivalent URLs with a single parameter. This could also indicate a much bigger problem, as it might imply an issue with the logic of the underlying software which generates the URLs in the first place.

On Page,,Issue,Medium,Contains Lorem Ipsum dummy text,"URLs that contain 'Lorem Ipsum' dummy text in the body content. 'Lorem Ipsum' is nonsensical and improper Latin text that is used by website designers as placeholder copy, and it is not uncommon for websites to get published with sections of 'Lorem Ipsum' copy still present.

Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Transferred image size is over 100KB,"Image URL files that are over 100KB, which is generally considered large. One of the easiest ways you can improve page load speed is by optimizing images and properly sizing them to the size that is rendered. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/transferred-image-size-is-over-100kb/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Low,Avoid excessive DOM width,"URLs for which the DOM has a parent node with more than the recommended 60 child nodes. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 60 elements wide. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/avoid-excessive-dom-width/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Low,Avoid excessive DOM depth,"URLs for which the DOM has nodes exceeding the maximum recommended depth of 32. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 32 elements deep. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/avoid-excessive-dom-depth/
Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Remove unused CSS,"URLs that contain 'unused CSS', which is not actually used for rendering. If you have 'unused CSS', this means that the browser needs to download CSS that it is not even going to use, delaying rendering in the process. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/remove-unused-css/
Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Remove unused JavaScript,"URLs that contain 'unused JavaScript', which is not actually used for rendering. If you have 'unused JavaScript', this means that the browser needs to download additional JavaScript that it is not even going to use, unnecessarily delaying rendering in the process. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/remove-unused-javascript/
Performance,,Opportunity,Low,Use video formats for animated content,URLs that contain animated content in GIF format. GIFs are problematic for performance because of their typically huge file size. Even a small clip of a few seconds can easily blow up to several MB of data - which results in additional resource that browsers need to download. ,https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/use-video-formats-for-animated-content/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Minify CSS,"URLs that contain CSS files that are not minified or could be minified further. Minification works by analyzing and rewriting the text-based parts of a file to reduce its overall size, resulting in faster response times and lower bandwidth costs. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/minify-css/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Defer offscreen images,"URLs that contain images which are fully loaded by the browser even though they are not visible in the user's viewport. This means that the browser spends time during the initial render downloading images that are not necessary to download right away, which increases the Time to Interactive. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/defer-offscreen-images/
Performance,,Opportunity,Low,Serve images in next gen formats,"URLs that contain images which are in older formats (BMP, JPEG or PNG). Older image formats do not offer the level of compression or quality characteristics as their newer, 'next-gen', counterparts: JPEG 2000, JPEG XR and WebP. Using a next-gen image format allows you to further reduce image file sizes. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/serve-images-in-next-gen-formats/
Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Properly size images,"URLs that contain images which are larger than the size they are rendered at. Serving images that are larger than the screen size available means that the browser needs to resize the images down to fit. From a user perspective, this means that they need to unnecessarily download useless data, which increases load time and is a waste of cellular data. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/properly-size-images/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Efficiently encode images,"URLs that contain images which are unoptimized. Image optimization is a valuable process because it allows you to serve images that are smaller in size (KiB) and therefore download faster, yet are not noticeably different to the user. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/efficiently-encode-images/
Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Add dimensions to images,"URLs that contain images which do not have width and height size attributes. If you don't specify width and height on images, when loading the page, the browser does not know how much space to allocate for the images. This results in an image 'jump', as the layout shifts around the images. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/add-dimensions-to-images/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Minify JavaScript,"URLs that contain JavaScript files that are not minified or could be minified further. Web servers and browsers can parse file content without comments and well-structured code, both of which create additional network traffic without providing any functional benefit. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/minify-javascript/
Performance,,Opportunity,Critical,Eliminate render blocking resources,"URLs that contain JavaScript or CSS that block the initial render of the page. 'Render blocking resources' are JS or CSS files that are not critical for the first paint of your page, yet still need to be processed before this first render can occur. This means you are forcing the browser to spend extra time on network transmission, decompressing, parsing and compiling code that is not actually necessary for the initial render. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/eliminate-render-blocking-resources/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Low,Avoid excessive DOM size,"URLs that contain more than 1500 elements in the DOM. While browsers can handle larger DOM trees, they are optimized for a maximum of 1500 nodes in total. A large DOM tree can harm network efficiency and load performance, runtime performance and memory performance. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/avoid-excessive-dom-size/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Critical,Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy,"URLs that contain page resources which do not specify a cache header. Fetching something over the network is both slow and expensive. Setting a cache header on your server response will tell the browser that it doesn't need to download assets again, which avoids unnecessary requests to the server. As such, HTTP caching can speed up your page load time on repeat visits. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/serve-static-assets-with-an-efficient-cache-policy/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Enable text compression,"URLs that contain text-based resources that are not served with compression. Compression makes text-based resources like HTML, CSS and JavaScript smaller, which means they download more quickly. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/enable-text-compression/
Performance,,Opportunity,Medium,Use HTTP/2 for all of its resources,URLs that do not use HTTP/2 for all first-party page resources. HTTP/2 serves your page's resources faster and with less data moving over the wire. ,https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/use-http2-for-all-of-its-resources/
Performance,,Opportunity,High,Reduce server response times (TTFB),"URLs that had a Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB) greater than 600ms. TTFB is a measure of how long it takes to receive data from the server, and high TTFB is a cause of slow page load. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/reduce-server-response-times-ttfb/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Critical,Avoid enormous network payloads,"URLs that have an extremely large page size (over 5Mb), which make them slow to download. A large page size translates into a large network payload when a browser requests the page. This takes the browser longer to download and process the page resources, and therefore longer to render the page. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/avoid-enormous-network-payloads/
Performance,,Diagnostic,Medium,Ensure text remains visible during webfont load,"URLs that hide text content until the webfont loads, causing a flash of invisible text. This means it takes longer before the user is able to engage with the text content, and also causes the layout to change during rendering, which can be jarring for the user. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/performance/ensure-text-remains-visible-during-webfont-load/
Redirects,,Insight,No Issue,External redirected URLs,"External URLs that redirect (3XX) to another URL.

Redirects,,Issue,High,Internal URL is part of a chained redirect loop,"Internal URLs that are part of a redirect chain which results in a redirect loop (e.g. URL 1 -> URL -> 2 -> URL 3 -> URL 1).

It is also bad for users, who will be shown an error page (e.g. 'Website redirected you too many times'). ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/redirects/internal-url-is-part-of-a-chained-redirect-loop/
Redirects,,Issue,Medium,Internal redirected URLs,"Internal URLs that redirect (3XX) to another URL. Redirects add an extra 'hop' to the request, which means it takes longer for the content to become available, which is a bad user signal, and means that search engine crawlers have to do additional 'work' to find the content. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/redirects/internal-redirected-urls/
Redirects,,Issue,High,Internal redirects from trailing slash mismatch,"Internal URLs that redirect due to a trailing slash mismatch. This occurs when the server encounters URLs that don't match expectation - so it will redirect to a URL that either adds or removes the trailing slash, depending on the setup. Internal links that cause these redirects cause unnecessary work for search engine crawlers, and the server itself, particularly when they are template based, and therefore widespread. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/redirects/internal-redirects-from-trailing-slash-mismatch/
Redirects,,Issue,High,Internal redirects from case normalization,"Internal URLs that redirect due to case normalization. This occurs when the server encounters URLs that don't match expectation - so it will redirect to a URL with characters of the correct case (typically lower case). Internal links that cause these redirects cause unnecessary work for search engine crawlers, and the server itself, particularly when they are template based, and therefore widespread. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/redirects/internal-redirects-from-case-normalization/
Redirects,,Issue,High,Internal URL redirects back to itself,"Internal URLs that redirect in a loop (e.g. URL 1 -> URL 1).

Redirects,,Issue,High,Resource URL redirect broken (4XX or 5XX),"Resource URLs that redirect to a URL which is Not Found (4XX) or Error (5XX). The URL in question is a page resource URL (e.g. CSS or JavaScript file), which means it is used for rendering the content on a page. If the resource is no longer accessible, this may affect how it is rendered, which could cause a poor user experience. ",https://sitebulb.com/hints/redirects/resource-url-redirect-broken-4xx-or-5xx/
Redirects,,Insight,No Issue,Redirects using a Meta refresh,"The Meta refresh is a simple on page redirect, and is usually used when it is not possible to implement a HTTP redirect. Search engines will follow a meta refresh, and pass on some link equity, but they offer a poor user experience so are not recommended.

",https://sitebulb.com/hints/rendered/canonical-only-in-the-rendered-html/
Rendered,,Issue,High,Canonical mismatch between rendered and response HTML,"URLs that contain a different canonical link in the response HTML to the rendered HTML, after JavaScript execution.

",https://sitebulb.com/hints/rendered/nofollow-only-in-the-http-response-html/
Rendered,,Issue,Critical,Noindex only in the HTTP response HTML,"URLs that contain a noindex in the response HTML, and not in the rendered HTML. When Google crawl new pages, they parse the response HTML; and for any URLs containing noindex, they skip the rendering process. So this means that these pages will not get queued for rendering, and therefore Google will not see in the rendered HTML that the noindex was not present, and the page will not get indexed.
